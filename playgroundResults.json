Naturally low in sugar, Oats supply slow-burning complex carbohydrates and hunger-filling dietary fiber. Whey proteins are readily digested and provide considerable amounts of essential amino acids (EAAs) - especially the three branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). Our Natural 100% Oats & Whey combines the benefits of these nutritional powerhouses in a smooth, drinkable shake that's quick to prepare and equally easy to clean up after. Each serving packs in 24 grams of all-whey protein and as much fiber as a big bowl of oatmeal. Better yet, it tastes great, and it goes down easy. As the name suggests, Natural 100% Oats & Whey is free of artificial flavors, sweeteners, and synthetic colors. So naturally, it's great for breakfast, after workouts, and any time that you're looking for an on-the-go meal.",

			"The final stretch is here. After weeks of pouring your heart and soul into your contest prep, you’re down to the final four days. You’ve done everything you could to get to this point, but now isn’t the time to start coasting. The next few days will be critical, with every little detail counting towards your end goal. Because you know, your audience knows, and the judges certainly know: It’s all about being your driest when you step onstage. When the difference between winning and losing comes down to millimetres, you need MICRO DRY™.*",

			"THE SCIENCE BEHIND micro•dry",
			"",
			"",
			"A Powerful Solution Supporting Your Goals.*",
			"MICRO•DRY is a natural – yet incredibly powerful – diuretic that supports your body to help rid it of excess salt (sodium) and water.*",
			"Proprietary Complexes Make MICRO•DRY One of a Kind",
			"MICRO•DRY’s THIN SKIN Complex contains a variety of natural ingredients including burdock root – a plant native to Europe and North Asia,",
			"Dandelion leaf - which also acts as a diuretic,",
			"Juniper fruit and Vitamin C.",
			"",
			"",
			"",
			"",
			"",
			"The ANTI-CRAMPING Complex is just as essential to peak athletic performance. Magnesium, for example, helps promote strong bones, a strong skeletal system, a healthy metabolism, and more energy.* While some magnesium is naturally found in the body, supplementation is crucial since most of us aren’t getting enough magnesium through our daily diet. The ANTI-CRAMPING Complex also contains potassium, which works with sodium to control the fluid in your cells.* With the help of magnesium, potassium is pushed into your cells and sodium is pushed out of your cells, helping to maintain a proper electrolyte balance and giving you the dry look you want.*",
			"",
			"",
			"",
			"How does MICRO•DRY work?",
			"MICRO•DRY is a natural – yet incredibly powerful – diuretic that supports your body to help rid it of excess salt (sodium) and water.*",
			"",
			"Who should use MICRO•DRY?",
			"MICRO•DRY has been formulated with competitive bodybuilders in mind, simply because of the high stakes associated with stepping onstage. After many weeks (usually 8 to 16) of grueling training and relentless dieting, it all comes down to how hard and defined a bodybuilder looks in front of the judges. Sure, size and shape are important. But someone who shows up soft or bloated won’t stand a chance against someone who’s hard and dry to the bone.*",
			"I’m not a competitive bodybuilder. Can I still use MICRO•DRY?",
			"Absolutely. While MICRO•DRY has been designed to meet the incredibly high demands of competitive bodybuilders, we recognize that not all bodybuilders will choose to compete. Some live the lifestyle because they want to continually better themselves, not because they’re in it to win. Other athletes from different sports altogether – such as boxing, mixed martial arts, etc. – can also benefit from MICRO•DRY.* At the end of the day, it’s not about what sport you play or what level you’re at. It’s about how shredded you want to become. MICRO•DRY is for anyone who wants to get rid of bloating, experience insane muscle definition and look his or her absolute tightest.* It’s as simple as that.",
			"What kind of events can MICRO•DRY help me prep for?",
			"Along with bodybuilding shows and other sporting events, there are a ton of special “everyday” events where you can benefit from using MICRO•DRY.* Got a beach trip coming up? A wedding or party you want to look great at? A photo shoot you want to nail? These are just a few instances where MICRO•DRY can give you the extra edge you need in looking your best.*",
			"Can MICRO•DRY help me lose fat?",
			"Proper diet and exercise can do that. MICRO•DRY shouldn’t be used as a method of permanent fat loss. If you’re looking for a powerful, scientifically advanced fat burner, check out SUB-Q® instead.*",
			"How do I take MICRO•DRY?",
			"Healthy adults should take three caplets daily, or as directed by a health care practitioner. As advised with all of our supplements, make sure to read the entire label before use.",

			"Look at the supplement facts panel on your favorite pre-workout product and you'll most likely see the term \"proprietary blend.\" Supplement companies want you to think this means they've created a special blend of ingredients that magically work together to deliver unique results. Because this blend is so amazing, they have to keep the doses of each ingredient secret so no other company steals the formula.",
			"The truth, however, is that propriety blends serve a different purpose. They allow supplement companies to hide how little of each ingredient they've actually put in a product. This results in cheap, underdosed, ineffective supplements.",
			"Pre JYM doesn't use proprietary blends.",
			"",
			"",
			"Proper Doses",
			"For the reasons detailed above, many supplement companies are moving toward transparency and axing proprietary blends. That's a good thing. However, these companies are still guilty of grossly underdosing ingredients.",
			"Take citrulline malate, for example. The research on this potent amino acid shows that you need 6 grams per dose. Most pre-workout products leave out citrulline entirely, and none of them provide anywhere close to 6 grams. Until now.",
			"You may notice that many ingredients in Pre JYM can also be found in Post JYM post workout active matrix. These products are formulated to work as a system to provide you with the optimal dose of each ingredient to get you the best results*",
			"",
			"",
			"No \"Abbreviated\" Formulas",
			"An abbreviated formula is one that uses proper dosing of all ingredients, but only includes a few ingredients.",
			"Take, for example, a pre-workout formula that includes beta-alanine, creatine, caffeine, and tyrosine. There's nothing wrong with it, but it could be made a lot more effective through the addition of ingredients like citrulline malate, betaine, and BCAAs, to name just a few. Why would companies not create the most robust formula possible? Because adding more ingredients costs too much money.",
			"Pre JYM includes 13 ingredients that work in concert to prime the body for intense workouts, making it the most complete pre-workout supplement available.*",
			"",
			"",
			"No Concentrates",
			"Many companies also try to trick buyers by calling their pre-workout product \"concentrated.\" A serving of one of these \"concentrated\" products can contain as few as 3 to 6 grams of powder. What kind of magic did they use to cram enough creatine, beta-alanine, citrulline, arginine, caffeine, and other ingredients into that tiny dose? They didn't use any magic, which is why all of those \"concentrated\" formulas also include proprietary blends. That's also why the serving size of Pre JYM is more than 26 grams.

			"",
			"Under the Microscope",
			"",
			"Let's take a closer look at each of the 13 ingredients and doses used to make Pre JYM such a pre-workout powerhouse.",
			"",
			"6g of Branched-Chain Amino Acids (BCAAs)",
			"",
			"The BCAAs are three amino acids —leucine, isoleucine, and valine—that share a common structure.",
			"Unlike other aminos, BCAAs are used directly by the muscles as an energy source.*",
			"Leucine is the most critical because it supports muscle protein synthesis (i.e., muscle growth).*",
			"Valine supports the blunting of fatigue, allowing you to work out longer.*",
			"The optimal ratio of leucine to isoleucine to valine in a pre-workout product is 2:1:1, exactly the ratio in Pre JYM.",
			"",
			"6g of Citrulline Malate",
			"",
			"Citrulline malate is composed of the amino acid citrulline attached to malic acid (malate).",
			"In the body, citrulline is readily converted to arginine, and then to nitric oxide (NO).",
			"Research suggests that citrulline increases arginine and NO levels in the body better than arginine itself.*",
			"Arginine undergoes excessive breakdown by the intestines and liver. Citrulline does not, so whatever you consume is readily absorbed and put to use.*",
			"Citrulline malate is also an energy booster backed by research.* One study reported that subjects consuming 6 grams of citrulline malate for 15 days experienced a 35% increase in ATP (energy) production during exercise and a 20% increase in phosphocreatine recovery between bouts of exercise.*",
			"Research also suggests that subjects supplementing with citrulline malate before a chest workout could complete at least one to two more reps on most sets compared to subjects taking a placebo.*",
			"",
			"2g of Creatine HCL",
			"",
			"There are hundreds of studies suggesting that creatine supplementation supports significant gains in muscle strength and power, as well as muscle growth.*",
			"Creatine HCL is made by attaching a hydrochloride (HCL) group to creatine.",
			"",
			"2g of CarnoSyn® Beta-Alanine",
			"",
			"Beta-alanine is taken up by muscle fibers and combines with the amino acid histidine to form carnosine.",
			"Research suggests that carnosine supports increases in strength and power, improves endurance and recovery.*",
			"One study suggested that four weeks of beta-alanine supplementation in boxers increased their average punching power in the last 10 seconds of a round by 2,000 percent more than those taking a placebo.* Being able to maintain punching power late in the round is similar to maintaining more strength and power later in your workouts, meaning you can lift more weight for more reps.*",
			"",
			"500mg of Beta Vulgaris L. (Beet) Extract",
			"",
			"Consuming beets (beta vulgaris), either by eating the whole beet, drinking beet juice or taking a beet extract, as in Pre JYM, has been suggested in numerous studies to enhance exercise performance.*",
			"The performance benefits of beet extract include greater exercise endurance and less fatigue.*",
			"This means that during a typical weightlifting workout, it could allow you to complete more reps with a given weight, and allow you to better maintain rep ranges and strength toward the end of the workout.*",
			"",
			"1.5g of Betaine",
			"",
			"Betaine, also known as trimethylglycine (TMG), is a modified version of the amino acid glycine.",
			"Betaine supplementation has been suggested in clinical studies to improve muscle strength and power production, increase the number of reps done with a given weight, and improve endurance.*",
			"University of Connecticut researchers reported that supplementing with 1.25 grams of betaine twice per day for two weeks increased bench press power by 20 percent and muscle force on the bench press by 25 percent.*",
			"Betaine has also been suggested to significantly increase protein synthesis following workouts as compared to a placebo.*",
			"",
			"300mg of Alpha-Glyceryl phosphoryl choline (Alpha-GPC)",
			"",
			"Alpha-glyceryl phosphoryl choline (alpha-GPC) is a naturally occurring phospholipid compound that plays a critical role in the way the brain, nervous system, and muscles function.*",
			"Alpha-GPC supports brain function and mood, promotes improved reaction time, and helps support focus and the mind-muscle connection during workouts.*",
			"Research suggests that, by increasing levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, alpha-GPC also supports muscle strength, power, and endurance.*",
			"",
			"600mg of N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC)",
			"",
			"NAC is the amino acid cysteine with an acetyl group attached to it. The acetyl group makes it more stable and allows the body to absorb and use it better than plain cysteine.*",
			"NAC is a powerful fatigue fighter that promotes energy production during exercise.*",
			"New research suggests that NAC works by preventing the disruption of the sodium-potassium pumps in muscle cells, delaying fatigue and maintaining muscle strength and endurance.*",
			"Research from the University of Kentucky Medical Center reported that subjects were able to perform strength exercises for 30 percent longer when they supplemented with NAC before exercise.*",
			"",
			"50mcg of Huperzine A",
			"",
			"This extract from club moss is a potent brain booster that may promote mental focus and support mood.*",
			"Huperzine A helps maintain optimal levels of acetylcholine, which is very helpful for brain and muscle function.*",
			"",
			"300mg of Caffeine",
			"",
			"Research confirms that caffeine can immediately increase muscle strength, improve muscle endurance, and decrease muscle fatigue during workouts, which allows you to take your training intensity to a higher level.*",
			"Caffeine is also suggested to be a nitric oxide (NO) booster. One study in the American Journal of Cardiology reported that healthy young men taking 300 mg of caffeine experienced an increase in NO levels and an increase in blood flow to muscles.*",
			"",
			"5mg of BioPerine®",
			"",
			"BioPerine® is a patented extract of the fruit of black pepper, or long pepper, that contains standardized amounts of the active ingredient piperine.",
			"Numerous clinical studies suggest that when a 5 mg dose of BioPerine® is taken with other supplements, it increases the absorption of those supplements by 30 to 2,000 percent.*",
			"",
			"1.5g of L-Tyrosine",
			"",
			"This amino acid supports alertness, mental focus, mood, and energy during intense exercise, especially when combined with caffeine.*",
			"",
			"1g of Taurine",
			"",
			"Taurine is a specialized amino acid that is important for endurance and muscle strength. It can also increase nitric oxide (NO) production.*",
			"Exercise depletes taurine levels, thereby impairing strength and endurance, so it's helpful to get a dose of taurine before every workout.*",
