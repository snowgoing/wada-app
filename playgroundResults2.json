In clinical studies, men and women who took 7-Keto® while exercising and following a calorie-restricted diet lost an average of 3 times more weight than subjects who took a placebo.*",

After 2 weeks, depending on tolerance, increase the dosage to 3 capsules in the morning and 3 capsules 4-6 hours later.",

Our Natural 100% Oats & Whey combines the benefits of these nutritional powerhouses in a smooth, drinkable shake that's quick to prepare and equally easy to clean up after. Each serving packs in 24 grams of all-whey protein and as much fiber as a big bowl of oatmeal. Better yet, it tastes great, and it goes down easy. As the name suggests, Natural 100% Oats & Whey is free of artificial flavors, sweeteners, and synthetic colors.
